### Overview
You can use this template to deploy some IBM Cloud Functions assets for you.  The assets created by this template are described in the manifest.yaml file, which can be found at `template-get-external-resource/runtimes/your_language_choice/manifest.yaml`

The only assets described by this get external resource template are a single action, named weather, which takes as input a location parameter.
